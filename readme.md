## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.  I did some data wrangling, including 1) drop rows with null vales, 2) correct the data types, 3) add columns of time of the day, and distance calculated from the start and end location


## Summary of Findings

1. Most rides last 0.03 to 0.28 hours, while very few of them last more than 1 hour. This suggests that most users are using the bike for short trips. Similarly, most distances are distributed between 0 to 4 kilimeters, with very few of the them lasting longer than 6 kilometers.

2. The distribution of start time clearly shows two modes: one during the morning rush hour between 7 to 10 am, another is during the evening rush hour between 5pm to 8pm. 

3. The age distribution among the users shows a left skewed distribution, with 20 to 40 years old being the most active group of people who use the bike.

4. Scatter plot of duration as a function of member age. It shows similar trend for all genders that younger people travel longer duration than older people. It is interesting to note that for a same age group, the duration can very a lot, which becomes larger for younger people.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I chose to show the distribution of ride duration, start time, age distribution, and duration-age relationship in the presentation.  I ploishd the plots with titles added and sizes optimized.  I also added transition text to make the flow of slides easier to follow.
